    "question": "Explain the accounting equation and demonstrate how it remains in balance when a business purchases equipment worth R50,000 using a bank loan.",
    "answer": "Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Purchasing equipment increases assets by R50,000 and increases liabilities (bank loan) by R50,000, keeping the equation balanced.",
    "explanation": "The fundamental accounting equation is <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong>. It represents the relationship between what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the owner's stake (equity). Every transaction must keep this equation in balance. In this scenario: <ul><li><strong>Assets (Equipment)</strong> increase by R50,000.</li><li><strong>Liabilities (Bank Loan)</strong> increase by R50,000.</li><li>Equity is unaffected.</li></ul> The equation becomes: (Original Assets + R50,000) = (Original Liabilities + R50,000) + Equity. Thus, the equation remains perfectly balanced."

    "explanation": "The risk-return trade-off is a fundamental principle of finance. It states that the potential return on an investment increases with risk. A rational investor will only take on higher risk if they are compensated with the potential for higher returns. For example, government bonds are low-risk and offer low returns, while stocks are higher-risk but offer the potential for significantly higher returns. Investors must balance their personal risk tolerance with their desired returns to build a suitable portfolio."

By minimizing the WACC, the firm maximizes its total market value.

    "explanation": "The Acid-Test (Quick) Ratio is a stricter measure of liquidity that excludes inventory. <br><strong>Formula:</strong> Acid-Test Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. <br><strong>1. Calculate Current Assets (Mahlaba Ltd):</strong> Inventory + Accounts Receivable + Cash = R125,000 + R90,000 + R2,000 = R217,000. <br><strong>2. Calculate Quick Assets:</strong> R217,000 - R125,000 (Inventory) = R92,000. <br><strong>3. Calculate the Ratio:</strong> R92,000 / R101,000 = <strong>0.91</strong>.

    "question": "Moyo Ltd has a days' inventory on hand of 30 days and a creditors' payment period of 95 days. Its debtors' collection period is 61 days. Calculate the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC).",
    "answer": "-4",
    "explanation": "The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) measures the number of days it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash. <br><strong>Formula:</strong> CCC = Days Inventory on Hand + Debtors Collection Period - Creditors Payment Period. <br><strong>Calculation:</strong> CCC = 30 + 61 - 95 = <strong>-4 days</strong>. <br><strong>Interpretation:</strong> A negative CCC is excellent. It means Moyo Ltd collects cash from its customers (in 61 days) before it has to pay its suppliers (in 95 days), effectively using its suppliers' money to finance its operations."
