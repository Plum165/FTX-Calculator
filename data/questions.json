    "question": "Explain the accounting equation and demonstrate how it remains in balance when a business purchases equipment worth R50,000 using a bank loan.",
    "answer": "Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Purchasing equipment increases assets by R50,000 and increases liabilities (bank loan) by R50,000, keeping the equation balanced.",
    "explanation": "The fundamental accounting equation is <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong>. It represents the relationship between what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the owner's stake (equity). Every transaction must keep this equation in balance. In this scenario: <ul><li><strong>Assets (Equipment)</strong> increase by R50,000.</li><li><strong>Liabilities (Bank Loan)</strong> increase by R50,000.</li><li>Equity is unaffected.</li></ul> The equation becomes: (Original Assets + R50,000) = (Original Liabilities + R50,000) + Equity. Thus, the equation remains perfectly balanced."

    "explanation": "The risk-return trade-off is a fundamental principle of finance. It states that the potential return on an investment increases with risk. A rational investor will only take on higher risk if they are compensated with the potential for higher returns. For example, government bonds are low-risk and offer low returns, while stocks are higher-risk but offer the potential for significantly higher returns. Investors must balance their personal risk tolerance with their desired returns to build a suitable portfolio."

By minimizing the WACC, the firm maximizes its total market value.
