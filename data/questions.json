    "question": "Explain the accounting equation and demonstrate how it remains in balance when a business purchases equipment worth R50,000 using a bank loan.",
    "answer": "Assets = Liabilities + Equity. Purchasing equipment increases assets by R50,000 and increases liabilities (bank loan) by R50,000, keeping the equation balanced.",
    "explanation": "The fundamental accounting equation is <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong>. It represents the relationship between what a company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the owner's stake (equity). Every transaction must keep this equation in balance. In this scenario: <ul><li><strong>Assets (Equipment)</strong> increase by R50,000.</li><li><strong>Liabilities (Bank Loan)</strong> increase by R50,000.</li><li>Equity is unaffected.</li></ul> The equation becomes: (Original Assets + R50,000) = (Original Liabilities + R50,000) + Equity. Thus, the equation remains perfectly balanced."

    "explanation": "The risk-return trade-off is a fundamental principle of finance. It states that the potential return on an investment increases with risk. A rational investor will only take on higher risk if they are compensated with the potential for higher returns. For example, government bonds are low-risk and offer low returns, while stocks are higher-risk but offer the potential for significantly higher returns.

    "answer": "Going Concern Concept",
    "explanation": "The Going Concern concept is the assumption that a business will remain in operation for the foreseeable future, without the intention or need for liquidation. This assumption is fundamental because it allows companies to record assets at their cost and depreciate them over their useful lives, rather than at their immediate liquidation value."

    "answer": "Retained earnings represent the cumulative amount of a company's net profits that have been kept in the business rather than paid out as dividends.",
    "explanation": "Retained earnings is a component of shareholders' equity on the Statement of Financial Position. It represents the historical profits that have been reinvested in the company. The calculation for the change in retained earnings over a period is: <br><strong>Ending Retained Earnings = Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Profit for the period - Dividends Declared during the period</strong>. <br>Therefore, the net profit for a period directly increases the retained earnings balance."

    "explanation": "Benchmarking provides context for a company's financial ratios. A ratio on its own is not very informative; its value comes from comparison. Common benchmarks include: <br>1. <strong>Industry Averages:</strong> Comparing a company's ratios to the average for its industry to see if it is performing above, below, or in line with its peers. <br>2. <strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> Comparing ratios directly against those of a key competitor. <br>3. <strong>Historical Trends:</strong> Comparing a company's current ratios to its own ratios from previous years to identify trends and changes in performance over time. <br><strong>Example:</strong> If a company's net profit margin is 8%, it might seem low.

    "explanation": "An aggressive policy aims to increase profitability by minimizing investment in low-yielding current assets (like inventory and cash) and using more short-term debt (which is typically cheaper).

Two common methods are: <br>1. <strong>Offer Early Settlement Discounts:</strong> Providing a discount (e.g., '2/10, net 30') gives customers a financial incentive to pay their invoices sooner than the due date. This can significantly shorten the average collection period. <br>2. <strong>Stricter Credit Policy and Monitoring:</strong> This involves conducting more thorough credit checks before granting credit, setting shorter credit periods, and actively monitoring overdue accounts.

    "answer": "A method to estimate the number of years it takes for an investment to double in value.",
    "explanation": "The Rule of 72 is a simple mental shortcut in finance. By dividing 72 by the annual interest rate, you can get a rough estimate of how many years it will take for your investment to double. For example, at an 8% interest rate, it would take approximately 72 / 8 = 9 years for an investment to double."

    "question": "Explain the concept of 'compounding' and why it is important for long-term investing.",
    "answer": "Compounding is the process of earning interest on both the original principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods.",
    "explanation": "Compounding is often described as 'interest on interest'. When you invest, you earn interest. In the next period, you earn interest on your initial investment plus the interest you earned in the first period. This creates a snowball effect. <br>It is crucial for long-term investing because the effect of compounding becomes much more powerful over longer time horizons. An investment that compounds for 40 years will grow exponentially more than one that compounds for only 10 years, even with the same principal and interest rate. This is why starting to save for retirement early is so important."

    "choices": ["Annually", "Semi-annually", "Quarterly", "Monthly"],
    "answer": "Annually",
    "explanation": "When you are borrowing, you want to pay the least amount of interest. More frequent compounding means interest is calculated and added to the principal more often, leading to a higher effective interest rate and more total interest paid over the life of the loan. Therefore, you would prefer the least frequent compounding period, which is annually."

    "answer": "There is an inverse relationship between present value and the discount rate.",
    "explanation": "The present value formula is PV = FV / (1 + i)^n. The discount rate (i) is in the denominator of the formula. This means that as the discount rate increases, the denominator gets larger, and the resulting present value gets smaller. Conversely, as the discount rate decreases, the present value gets larger. This makes intuitive sense: a higher discount rate implies a higher required return or more risk, so a future cash flow is worth less in today's terms."

For example, if a company spent R50,000 on market research for a new product last year, that R50,000 is a sunk cost.

It is only appropriate to use this WACC to evaluate new projects that have the same level of risk as the company's current business. <br>If a new project is significantly riskier, using the overall WACC would be incorrect. A riskier project requires a higher rate of return to compensate investors for the additional risk.

    "explanation": "At the break-even point, the company has made enough profit from selling its products to cover all of its fixed costs for the period.

    "answer": "Operating leverage measures the sensitivity of a company's operating income to changes in its sales volume. A high degree of operating leverage signifies high fixed costs and high risk.",
    "explanation": "Operating leverage relates to a company's cost structure (the mix of fixed and variable costs). <br><strong>High Operating Leverage:</strong> A company with high fixed costs and low variable costs (e.g., an airline) has high operating leverage. This means that once the break-even point is passed, a small percentage increase in sales will result in a much larger percentage increase in operating profit. However, it also means the company is risky; a small drop in sales can lead to a large drop in profit or significant losses. <br><strong>Low Operating Leverage:</strong> A company with low fixed costs and high variable costs (e.g., a retail store) has low operating leverage. Its profits are less sensitive to changes in sales."

    "explanation": "The Margin of Safety shows how much sales could fall before the company starts to incur a loss. It can be expressed in units, in rands, or as a percentage. It is a crucial measure of risk. A company with a large margin of safety is in a strong position and can withstand a significant drop in sales without becoming unprofitable. A company with a small margin of safety is in a riskier position, as even a minor downturn in sales could push it into a loss-making situation."

    "answer": "This transaction is a conversion of one asset to another and does not involve any income or expense.",
    "explanation": "This is an asset swap. The 'Bank' asset account increases by R10,000, and the 'Accounts Receivable' asset account decreases by R10,000. The net effect on total assets is zero. Equity was already increased when the original sale was made and the revenue was recognized. The collection of the cash is simply the settlement of that receivable and does not create new revenue. Therefore, equity is unaffected by the cash collection itself."

The order of preference is: <br>1. <strong>Internal Funds (Retained Earnings):</strong> This is the first choice because it requires no new issuance and sends no negative signals to the market. <br>2. <strong>Debt:</strong> If internal funds are insufficient, firms will issue debt. This is seen as less costly than issuing equity and sends a less negative signal. <br>3. <strong>New Equity:</strong> This is the last resort.

    "answer": "The tax shield is the tax saving a company achieves by using debt. It makes capital structure relevant by making debt financing cheaper than equity financing.",
    "explanation": "When Modigliani and Miller relaxed their 'no taxes' assumption, their conclusions changed. Because interest payments on debt are tax-deductible, a company saves money on taxes by using debt. The value of this tax saving is called the tax shield. <br><strong>Value of Tax Shield = Interest Payment * Tax Rate</strong>. <br>This tax shield adds value to the company. Therefore, in a world with taxes, the theory suggests that a company's value increases as it uses more debt. The optimal capital structure, under this simplified model, would be 100% debt."

    "explanation": "While the tax shield makes debt attractive, there are significant offsetting costs: <br>1. <strong>Costs of Financial Distress:</strong> As a company takes on more debt, the probability that it will be unable to meet its interest and principal payments increases. This can lead to bankruptcy. Even if bankruptcy is avoided, the company may incur other costs, such as losing customers who are worried about its stability or having to sell assets at a low price. <br>2. <strong>Loss of Financial Flexibility:</strong> A company with a large amount of debt may find it difficult to raise additional capital if a profitable investment opportunity suddenly arises. Lenders may be unwilling to extend more credit, and the company may have restrictive covenants in its existing loan agreements that limit its actions."

    "question": "A company is preparing its cash budget for the second quarter (April-June). Credit sales are: Jan R50k, Feb R60k, Mar R80k, Apr R100k. The collection pattern is 50% in the month of sale and 50% in the month following. Calculate the total cash collected from credit sales in April.",
    "answer": "90000",
    "explanation": "Cash collections in April will come from sales made in March and April. <br><strong>1. Collections from April Sales:</strong> R100,000 * 50% = R50,000. <br><strong>2. Collections from March Sales:</strong> R80,000 * 50% = R40,000. <br><strong>3. Total Collections in April:</strong> R50,000 + R40,000 = <strong>R90,000</strong>."

    "answer": "Sensitivity analysis involves creating several cash budgets under different assumptions to see how the outcomes change.",
    "explanation": "A cash budget is based on forecasts, which are uncertain. Sensitivity analysis (or 'what-if' analysis) is a technique used to test the impact of this uncertainty. For example, management might prepare three cash budgets: <br>1. <strong>Most Likely Scenario:</strong> Based on the most probable sales forecast. <br>2. <strong>Pessimistic Scenario:</strong> Based on a lower sales forecast. <br>3. <strong>Optimistic Scenario:</strong> Based on a higher sales forecast. <br>By comparing the outcomes, management can understand the potential range of cash surpluses or deficits and develop contingency plans."

    "answer": "40000",
    "explanation": "The company needs to borrow enough to cover its operating deficit and to restore its minimum cash balance. <br><strong>Financing Needed:</strong> Amount of Deficit + Minimum Required Balance = R25,000 + R15,000 = <strong>R40,000</strong>."

    "answer": "The company could use the surplus to pay down debt or invest in short-term securities.",
    "explanation": "Letting a large amount of cash sit idle in a bank account is inefficient as it earns little to no return. Productive uses for a surplus include: <br>1. <strong>Repay Debt:</strong> Using the cash to pay off high-interest short-term debt (like a bank overdraft) or make an early payment on a long-term loan can save the company significant interest expense. <br>2. <strong>Invest in Short-Term Securities:</strong> The company can invest the surplus cash in low-risk, liquid investments such as a money market fund or short-term government bonds. This allows the idle cash to earn a return while remaining accessible if needed."

    "answer": "More frequent compounding means interest is earned on previously earned interest more often.",
    "explanation": "With annual compounding, interest is calculated and added to the principal once a year. With semi-annual compounding, interest is calculated twice a year. In the second half of the year, you earn interest not only on the original principal but also on the interest that was earned in the first half of the year. This 'interest on interest' effect is more powerful the more frequently compounding occurs, leading to a higher effective annual rate and a higher future value."

    "answer": "An uneven cash flow stream is a series of cash flows where the amount of each payment is not the same. Its present value is found by discounting each individual cash flow separately and then summing the results.",
    "explanation": "Unlike an annuity, where all payments are equal, an uneven cash flow stream has different cash flow amounts in different periods (e.g., R100 in Year 1, R200 in Year 2, R150 in Year 3). To find the present value of such a stream, you cannot use the simple annuity formula. Instead, you must treat each cash flow as a separate lump sum and discount it back to the present using the formula PV = CFt / (1 + i)^t for each cash flow (CF) in each period (t). The total present value is the sum of all these individual present values."

    "explanation": "When you are saving or investing, you want to maximize the effect of compounding.

    "answer": "Opportunity cost is the return you give up by investing in one project over another, and it is a key component of the discount rate.",
    "explanation": "The time value of money exists because a rand received today can be invested to earn a return. The discount rate (or required rate of return) used in TVM calculations represents this opportunity cost. If you have an alternative investment that could safely earn you 8%, then 8% is your opportunity cost of capital. Any new project you consider must earn at least 8% to be worthwhile. Therefore, the discount rate reflects the return you are forgoing on the next best alternative investment with similar risk."
